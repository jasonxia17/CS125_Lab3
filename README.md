Converts text files into an array of words.
Provides various functions to analyze that array of words, including word counting, unique word counting, and word frequencies.

Originally for CS 125 Lab 3, but many functionalities have been extended.

## Visualization of Word Frequencies

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, top 50 words from the csv file: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/n1fdceby78

This is an attempt at visualizing Zipf's Law: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law
Theoretically, the frequency of the word should be inversely proportional to the word's rank.
